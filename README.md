# Colour Guessing Game

## Introduction

This is a recreation of the game that I was tasked to make in python during my T-Level course, I have descided to recreate it in PHP as a way to learn the language.

## Dependencies

This game requires the following dependencies to be installed:

- [WampServer](https://www.wampserver.com/en/) or [XAMPP](https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html)

## Project Requirements

- The game must provide a random colour for both the text and background, the user must then guess the colour of the text.
- The game should have a timer of 30 seconds.
- The game should keep track of the users score.

## Additional Features

- The game should allow the user to login or register an account.
- The game should store the users score in a database.
- The game should have a leaderboard that keeps track of the top 10 scores.

## Possible Future Features

- The game could have a difficulty setting that changes the time limit.
